#### Academic Expereince  

## Introduction to Computer Programming  
[Final Project](/AcademicExperience/COE301): The purpose of this project was to visualize a set of [data](/AcademicExperience/COE301/data/cells.mat) that represented the spread of a rat's brain tumor over the course of serveral days.  


## Introduction to Scientific Programming
[Final Project](/AcademicExperience/SDS322/SDS322_FinalProject): The goal of this project was to create a code that simulated the spread of a disease throughout a given population.  

## Engineering Graphics and Design
[Reverse Engineering Project](/AcademicExperience/ME302/FinalProject): This semester long group project was a reverse engineering of a Kuhn Rikon Ratchet Grinder. It consisted of a object disection and mechanical subsystem analization, part sketching and CAD modeling in SolidWorks and proposals for future improvements.  

## Engineering Communcation
[Independent Emotional Intelligence Report](/AcademicExpereince/Emotional_Intelligence_Report): One of the main topics disucced in this course was Emotional Intelligence (EQ). For this independent study I choose to implement a self-intervention determine if guided meditation improves EQ.   

[An Ethical Analytic Comparison Between Restoration and Improvement](/AcademicExpereince/ASE333T/GC_FinalReport): A semester long, group research project discussing the ethics of difference methods of restoration and improvement in maintain  urban infrastructure.
