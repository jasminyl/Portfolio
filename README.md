## Academic Experience  

### Introduction to Computer Programming  
[Final Project](/AcademicExperience/COE301): The purpose of this project was to visualize a set of [data](/AcademicExperience/COE301/data/cells.mat) that represented the spread of a rat's brain tumor over the course of several days.  


### Introduction to Scientific Programming
[Final Project](/AcademicExperience/SDS322/SDS322_FinalProject.pdf): The goal of this project was to create a code that simulated the spread of a disease throughout a given population.  

### Engineering Graphics and Design
[Reverse Engineering Project](/AcademicExperience/ME302/FinalProject.pdf): This semester long group project was a reverse engineering of a Kuhn Rikon Ratchet Grinder. It consisted of an object dissection and mechanical subsystem analyzation, part sketching and CAD modeling in SolidWorks and proposals for future improvements.  

### Engineering Communication
[Independent Emotional Intelligence Report](/AcademicExperience/ASE333T/Emotional_Intelligence_Report.pdf): One of the main topics discussed in this course was Emotional Intelligence (EQ). For this independent study, I choose to implement a self-intervention determine if guided meditation improves EQ.   

[An Ethical Analytic Comparison Between Restoration and Improvement](/AcademicExperience/ASE333T/GC_ FinalReport.pdf): A semester-long group research project discussing the ethics restoration and improvement methods in maintaining urban infrastructure.
